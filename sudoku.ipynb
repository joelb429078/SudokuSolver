    "# Solving Sudoku Puzzles\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Sudoku is a popular logic-based number puzzle. It consists of a 9x9 grid, divided into nine 3x3 subgrids. Some cells contain numbers, while others are empty. The objective is to fill the empty cells with numbers from 1 to 9, ensuring each number appears exactly once in each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Writing an Efficient Sudoku Solver\n",
    "To tackle the challenge of solving Sudoku puzzles programmatically, I developed an efficient Sudoku solver. The approach and algorithm used can greatly influence the solver's performance and accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Grid Representation**: Use a 9x9 matrix to represent the Sudoku grid, where zeros represent empty cells.\n",
    "2. **Constraint Propagation**: Implement constraint propagation to reduce the search space by eliminating impossible values for each cell.\n",
    "3. **Backtracking Search**: Develop a recursive backtracking function that attempts to fill the grid, backtracking when a constraint violation is detected.\n",
    "4. **Optimisation**: Enhance the solver with techniques such as forward-checking and the Minimum Remaining Value heuristic to improve efficiency.\n",
    "5.**Testing and Validation**: Test the solver with a variety of Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty to ensure robustness and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample Puzzles\n",
    "\n",
    "To validate the solver, I used a set of sample Sudoku puzzles. Each puzzle is represented as a 9x9 NumPy array, with zeros indicating empty cells. The sample set includes puzzles of different difficulty levels, providing a comprehensive test bed for the solver.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Performance Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve a high grade, the solver's speed is a critical factor. Efficient implementation of constraint satisfaction and optimization techniques is essential for handling more challenging puzzles within a reasonable timeframe.\n"

    "### Testing Details\n",
    "There are four difficulties of sudoku provided: very easy, easy, medium, and hard. There are 15 sample sudokus in each category, with solutions as well. Difficulty was determined using reference solvers.\n",
    "\n",
    "*All categories that are easy and above will contain* ***invalid initial states***, that is, sudoku puzzles with no solution. In this case, my function should return a 9x9 NumPy array whose values are all equal to -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I will test my code, we will firstly test it on the *same* very easy puzzles that you have been given. Then we will test it on additional *hidden* sudokus from each difficulty in turn, easy and up. Grades are awarded based on whether my code can solve the puzzles. For high grades on the hard puzzles, execution time will also be a factor. \n",
    "\n",
    "All puzzles must take under 30 seconds each on the test machine to count as successful, but you should be aiming for an average of under a second per puzzle. Hardware varies, but all tests will take place on the same modern desktop machine. Our ‘standard constraint satisfaction’ implementation takes about 0.001 seconds per puzzle for the very easy category, but struggles to solve some of the hard puzzles within the time limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "***The hard sudokus are labelled as hard for a reason.*** We expect most submissions will not be able to solve them in a reasonable length of time. Use the stop button (■) on the toolbar if you need to terminate my code because it is taking too long.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to improve the performance of my code is through a detailed understanding and smart choice of AI algorithms. This assignment is ***not*** meant to test the ability to write multi-threaded code or any other kind of high-performance code optimisations. \n",
